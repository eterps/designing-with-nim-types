# Designing with Nim types

Nim translation of Scott Wlaschin's [Designing with types](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-intro/) series.

It is recommended to read Scott Wlaschin's article (the F# version) first, as it explains the concept carefully.
Then click on the Nim version to see the Nim translation of that concept.
